        <p>Flowers are the reproductive structures of flowering plants, also known as blooms or blossoms. They are made up of vegetative organs, such as sepals and petals, and reproductive organs, such as stamens and pistils. The number of these parts varies between plants, which determines whether the flower is complete or incomplete.Flowers have a floral axis, which is a modified stem that bears the reproductive organs and accessory organs. The reproductive organs are the stamens and pistils, and the accessory organs are the sepals and petals. The sepals protect the developing flower, and the petals attract pollinators. The male gametophytes, which produce sperm, are in the pollen grains, and the female gametophytes are in the ovules. </p>
